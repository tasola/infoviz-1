    <div id="teamBio">The Plot Twitch team, consists of 8 interaction design master’s students from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The Plot Twitch product is the final project in the course DH2321 Information Visualization, supervised by Dr Mario Romero Vega, and brought to action during the spring of 2018.</div>

  <div class="teamBioLeft"><h2>Alexandra</h2><h4>FRONT END DEVELOPER / OFFICE PROVIDER<br/><br/>Alexandra is one of our front-end developers and UX designers. Her positive and driven attitude combined with a non-existent fear for trying new things until they work makes her an ideal part of any development team. Her curiosity and master skills in searching the web for the right solutions has brought the team home. In the Plot Twitch project, her main responsibility has been to set up scatter plots, master the voronoi functionality and caring for the stars/viewers counter.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamBioRight"><h2>Arvid</h2><h4>FRONT END DEVELOPER / LOVER OF BOOTSTRAP<br/><br/>Arvid is one of our full stack developers, although ultimately favoring the front-end tasks. His knowledge and “big picture” thinking has made him part of the glue between the front-end and back-end developers in our team. In the Plot Twitch project, Arvid has in the beginning of the project been part of the data team together with Axel and Viktor, while towards the end of the project moved more towards handling the scatter plots and implementing small design details.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamBioLeft"><h2>Axel</h2><h4>FULL STACK DEVELOPER / HANDLER OF CRISIS<br/><br/>Axel is our data-wizard and all-knowing full stack developer. His level of knowledge on back-end (and scatter plot) solutions exceeds everyone else’s and he’s always been the one with the answers, no matter what questions the team throws at him. He has a meticulous care for code, to say the least. His main responsibility has been to lead the back-end team and setting up the data management, including setting up the Vue.js framework, the API requests and the Firebase structure.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamBioRight"><h2>Glenn</h2><h4>PROJECT MANAGER / CONJURER OF COFFEE<br/><br/>Glenn is the project leader and agile coach for the team. His inclusive manner and hawk-like eye for details made him the ultimate captain for our ship. Without Glenn, there would just be a bunch of code crazy developers and designers not being able to synchronize their work, tumbling around in the dark. As the project leader of Plot Twitch, Glenn has kept us all in check while simultaneously delivering data insights and analytic trails, recognizing pain points and encouraged us to keep the user groups and usability points in mind.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamBioLeft"><h2>Linnea</h2><h4>UX/UI DESIGNER / PIXEL PUSHER<br/><br/>Our designer and UX anchor. A master of her craft, Plot Twitch would have looked like an Excel Sheet if it wasn’t for her. She always seemed to have a solution to many of the obstacles we encountered on the road and made sure we were always aligned in our vision, not only in our minds, but by continuously updating our graphical profile and all it entices. Among a plethora of contributions she authored our analytical trail, presented our progress and by questioning her and our design choices she made sure that Plot Twitch is the data driven visualization you see today.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamImageRight"><img class="image" src="../assets/img/matilda.png"></div>
  <div class="teamBioRight"><h2>Matilda</h2><h4>DESIGNER / PRESENTATION MANAGER<br/><br/>Matilda’s catch phrase is “make it pretty” and for obvious reasons she was part of the design team to begin with. She later transitioned between both the design team and the front end team, made our presentations pretty, accumulated the feedback we received, reminded us to incorporate it and took lead on our C-award submission to make sure that it accurately reflects the effort we put into this project.</h4></div>

  <div class="teamImageLeft"><img class="image" src="../assets/img/viktor.png"></div>
  <div class="teamBioLeft"><h2>Viktor</h2><h4>FULL STACK DEVELOPER / GITHUB MASTER<br/><br/>Viktor, or Ceder, as we passionately call him, has been paramount to the success of this project due to his skills as a full stack developer and love for Github. Very early on in the project he took it upon himself to make sure that whatever we pushed, pulled, requested, branched ended up exactly where it should and was steadily available for everyone else (even in the early morning hours!). Our global controller (the slider) was his masterpiece but his input was crucial for a lot of what is visible and invisible in Plot Twitch.

  <div class="teamBioRight"><h2>Petter</h2><h4>FULL STACK DEVELOPER / HATER OF MERGING<br/><br/>A developer with a soft spot for details and affinity for structure, it was thanks to him that our team got a second wind as we neared the final stretch of this project. He basically forced us to allocate as much time as possible to this project. Moving from the back-end team to the front-end team he, on countless occasions, pushed his machine to the limit to make sure Plot Twitch navigation and routing makes as much sense to you as it made to us.</h4></div>
