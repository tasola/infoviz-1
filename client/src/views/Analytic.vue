      <div id="teamBio">You are an advertiser, excited to dive into the deep end of the influencer-pool, and the aim has been set towards the gamer community. You look to Twitch, a large streaming service. Surely there has to be some information to get from there. Imagine starting to explore the Twitch community, where millions of people and thousand of interests collide in what Twitch calls “a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture and conversation”. Where to begin? As an advertiser, you could be interested in the top 100 largest streams right now, to get a quick overview on where the eyes and the influentials are.
<br/><br/>
There are several variables to explore here — if there are any specific games that are popular and if so, if there are a lot of streamers streaming that particular game, or if there’s one big stream where all the viewers are. Here we can conclude both information about specific streamers and about specific games, and if it is the streamer/player who is the popular one or if it is the game itself, or maybe a combination of both.
<br/><br/>
As you are presented with Plot Twitch, you are greeted with a introductory page where some basic and necessary information is given. What you are about to explore contains the top 100 largest streams on Twitch right now, with the option to go back in time, which will work to your advantage in a minute, but you might not have gotten to that insight just yet.
<br/><br/>
The top 100 streams are in a scatterplot-like view where the currently played games are clustered and placed in space based on their current viewer amounts. Using the slider in the bottom of the page we allow you to scroll 24 hours back in time to observe current popularity trends among the games being streamed and viewed. What we aimed for here is a true data driven visualization. Notice the stars in the background represent the current viewership of the top 100 streams. Not surprising, to ensure a smooth interaction, we had to aggregate 1000 viewers on one star. To visualize over 14 000 starts would make it cluttered and slow! However, the number of total current viewership is visible at the top left corner.
<br/><br/>
When you hover on a cluster you get information to your right about the game and the total amount of viewers. When you click on a cluster, you are zoomed in and focused on that particular game. Here you see another scatterplot, with its axes visible and a clear visual aid on hover
