## About
Plot Twitch is a tool for Twitch advertisers to identify the next rising star of game streaming. The plot shows the 100 most viewed streams on Twitch right now. The X axis represents the total viewership of all time, whereas the Y axis represents the current amount of views. With this information it is easy for an advertiser to look for an uprising, unexplored Twitch streamer by looking for a game that has many views right now (high X value), but not so many historically (low Y value). You can draw further conclusions by going back in time using the time axis in the bottom.
